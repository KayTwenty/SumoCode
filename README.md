# SumoCode
Welcome to the official repository for the sumo bot code!

## Introduction
The SumoCode repository contains the source code for our sumo bot, which is designed for the upcoming sumo robot competition. This repository serves as a central hub for managing and version-controlling our codebase.

## Features
Our sumo bot code includes the following features and modules:
1. **Motor Controls:** Provides control functions for the individual motors of the sumo bot.
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Enables the detection of objects or opponents using an ultrasonic sensor.
3. **Light Sensor:** Allows the sumo bot to sense the presence of light and make decisions based on light conditions.
4. **Sumo Bot Controller:** Orchestrates the overall behavior of the sumo bot by integrating motor controls, sensor inputs, and decision-making algorithms.

## Getting Started
To get started with the sumo bot code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KayTwenty/SumoCode.git
```
2. Connect the sumo bot to the Arduino uno.
3. Open the Arduino IDE (or any compatible IDE) and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. Load the `sumo_bot.ino` sketch file into the Arduino IDE.
5. Make sure to adjust the pin configurations in the code to match your setup.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
7. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as needed for your specific requirements.
